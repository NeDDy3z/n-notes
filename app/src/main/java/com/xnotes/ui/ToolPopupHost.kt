/**
 * What a tool popup needs from whichever editor is open.
 *
 * The popups are the same controls on either surface, so they are the same composables rather than
 * a second set that resembles them. A lookalike drifts: a control added to one, a label reworded, a
 * range widened, and the two stop matching in ways nobody notices until a user does. Taking the few
 * members the popups actually read through an interface is what makes "identical" a property of the
 * code rather than a thing to keep checking.
