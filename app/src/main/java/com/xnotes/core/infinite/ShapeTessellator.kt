/**
 * Turns a [ShapeItem] into triangles: the fill first, then the outline over it, each with its own
 * colour, exactly as the paged renderer paints them.
 *
 * The outline needs no path stroker. Every kind reduces to a polyline, closed or open, and a
 * constant-width ribbon with a disc at each vertex draws the same silhouette a round-capped,
 * round-joined pen would. Only the fill needs real triangulation, and three of the four fillable
 * kinds are analytic; a recognized polygon is the one case that ear-clips, and it arrives with a
 * few dozen vertices at most.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, so the geometry is unit-testable without a canvas.
